## System Overview

DoneisBetter is a modern web application for comparing and ranking items through a combination of swiping and voting mechanisms. The application implements a sophisticated ranking algorithm that dynamically adjusts item positions based on user votes. The system has several core features:

- **Card Management**: Create, update, and browse items presented as cards
- **Swipe Interface**: Quick decision-making with swipe gestures
- **Voting Arena**: Head-to-head comparison of items
- **Rankings**: Dynamically updated rankings based on ELO-inspired algorithm
- **Administration**: Management of cards and system settings

The application follows a modern Next.js architecture with server-side rendering, API routes, and real-time capabilities through Socket.io.

## Architecture Components

### Frontend Architecture

The frontend is built with Next.js and follows a component-based architecture with the following organization:

```
components/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ base/           # Base components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/        # Feature-specific components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ features/       # Feature modules
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ swipe/      # Swipe interface components
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ vote/       # Voting interface components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ layout/         # Layout components
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Header.js   # Main navigation header
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Layout.js   # Page layout wrapper
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ MobileNav.js # Mobile navigation menu
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ui/             # Reusable UI components
```

#### Key Components

1. **Navigation Components**:
   - `Header.js`: Desktop navigation menu with links to all main sections
   - `Navigation.js`: Alternative navigation component
   - `MobileNav.js`: Mobile-optimized navigation

2. **Feature Components**:
   - `SwipeCard.js`: Card swiping implementation with gesture controls
   - `CardStack.js`: Management of card stacks for swiping
   - `VoteArena.js`: Voting interface for head-to-head comparison
   - `VoteCard.js`: Card display in voting interface
   - `VoteControls.js`: Voting control buttons and keyboard navigation

3. **UI Components**:
   - Various reusable UI elements (buttons, cards, modals, etc.)
   - Animation components for transitions

### Backend Architecture

The backend is implemented within the Next.js framework using API routes and serverless functions:

```
pages/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ api/           # API endpoints
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cards/     # Card management endpoints
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ vote/      # Voting endpoints
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pair.js       # Get card pairs for voting
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ rankings.js   # Get current rankings
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ submit.js     # Submit vote results
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ interactions/     # User interaction tracking
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ results/          # Results and analytics
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [page].js      # Frontend pages
```

### Database Architecture

The application uses MongoDB with Mongoose ODM for data management:

```
models/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Card.js        # Card schema and model
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ VotePair.js    # Vote pair tracking
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ VoteRank.js    # Card rankings
```

## Core Algorithms

### Voting and Ranking Algorithm

The ranking system implements a sophisticated algorithm that dynamically adjusts item positions based on user votes. Here's how it works:

1. **Initial Ranking**:
   - When two unranked cards are compared, the winner gets rank 1, loser gets rank 2
   - The system initializes with wins, totalVotes, and other metrics

2. **New Card vs. Ranked Card**:
   - When a new card wins against a ranked card, it takes that rank position
   - All cards at or below that position are shifted down
   - When a new card loses, it's placed one rank below the winner

3. **Ranked vs. Ranked Card**:
   - When a higher-ranked card wins against a lower-ranked card, only vote counts update
   - When a lower-ranked card wins against a higher-ranked card, the winner moves up to the loser's position
   - Cards between their positions are shifted down

4. **Win Rate Calculation**:
   - Win rate is calculated as: `winRate = (wins / totalVotes) * 100`
   - This provides a percentage-based metric for card performance

#### Ranking Implementation Details

```javascript
// Pseudo-code for ranking algorithm core
if (!winnerRank && !loserRank) {
  // Both cards are new
  createRank(winner, 1);
  createRank(loser, 2);
} else if (!winnerRank) {
  // Winner is new
  shiftRanksDown(loserRank.rank);
  createRank(winner, loserRank.rank);
  updateVoteCounts(loser);
} else if (!loserRank) {
  // Loser is new
  shiftRanksDown(winnerRank.rank + 1);
  createRank(loser, winnerRank.rank + 1);
  updateVoteCounts(winner);
} else if (winnerRank.rank > loserRank.rank) {
  // Winner is currently ranked below loser
  shiftRanksBetween(loserRank.rank, winnerRank.rank);
  updateRank(winner, loserRank.rank);
  updateVoteCounts(loser);
} else {
  // Winner already ranked above loser
  updateVoteCounts(winner);
  updateVoteCounts(loser);
}
```

### Swipe Mechanism

The swipe interface uses gesture detection to allow users to make quick decisions:

1. **Gesture Detection**: Uses touch and mouse events to detect swipe direction
2. **Direction Processing**:
   - Right swipe: Positive/Like
   - Left swipe: Negative/Dislike
   - Up swipe: Super like (when implemented)
3. **Animation Flow**:
   - Card follows finger/mouse position with physics-based animation
   - When released, card either returns to center (if not swiped far enough) or completes the swipe animation
   - Next card is revealed with transition animation

## Frontend Implementation

### State Management

The application uses React's built-in state management with Context API for global state:

1. **Local Component State**: For UI-specific state (animations, local form data)
2. **Context Providers**: For shared state (theme, user preferences, authentication)
3. **Real-time Updates**: Socket.io for live updates to rankings and votes

### Navigation System

The navigation system consists of multiple components that work together:

1. **Header.js**: Main navigation menu for desktop view with items:
   - Home üè†
   - Rankings üèÜ
   - Swipe üîÑ
   - Vote üó≥Ô∏è
   - Admin ‚öôÔ∏è

2. **MobileNav.js**: Mobile-optimized navigation with similar items

3. **Key Navigation Features**:
   - Active page highlighting
   - Dark/light mode toggle (üåô/üåû)
   - Animated transitions between pages
   - Mobile responsiveness

### UI Components

The UI is built with a combination of Tailwind CSS and custom components:

1. **Card Components**: For displaying items in various contexts
2. **Button Components**: Various button styles for actions
3. **Modal Components**: For dialogs and pop-ups
4. **Animation Components**: For transitions and micro-interactions
