# 01_ROADMAP.md — DONEISBETTER

## 📍 Current Phase: User Preferences & Statistics

This roadmap outlines the strict, incremental steps required to complete the doneisbetter prototype according to the "Done is Better Than Perfect" philosophy. All tasks are performed **sequentially**, must be tested independently, and deployed on **Vercel Production** after each step.

## 🔄 Phase Structure

Each phase must be:
- Fully implemented
- Tested locally
- Committed to GitHub
- Deployed on Vercel
- Documented and verifiable

## 📘 Notes

- Each phase is delivered independently and verified via deployment.
- Card data is manually tested.
- Deployment is strictly tied to GitHub commits.
- Admin and User sides are developed in parallel only after backend is stable.
- Phases 5-8 represent future development potential after the core application is stable.
