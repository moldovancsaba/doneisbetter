# AI Development Conversation Plan

## Current Development Stage

Currently analyzing the project state through recent history:

- Latest version is v4.2.2 (2025-07-07T09:39:40Z)
- Core implementation includes:
  - Card rating system (ELO-based, default 1400)
  - Vote and Swipe mechanics integration
  - Strict image aspect ratio preservation
  - Centralized UI components

## Critical Components

### Card Component
- Located at `/src/components/common/Card.tsx`
- Core functionality:
  - Automatic aspect ratio preservation
  - Container-based sizing
  - Cross-browser compatibility
  - No text overlays

### Vote System
- ELO-based rating (K-factor: 32)
- Initial rating: 1400
- Progressive difficulty
- Real-time updates

### Layout Rules
- Navigation height: 80px
- Card container: max-w-[80vw]
- Perfect vertical centering
- Aspect ratio preservation

## Active Tasks

### From TASKLIST.md
1. Vote and Swipe Integration
   - Status: In Progress
   - Priority: P0
   - Due: 2025-07-13T23:59:59.999Z
   - Components:
     - Rename VoteBattle to Vote
     - Update vote direction handling
     - Enhance swipe detection
     - Connect vote results to ranking

2. Test Suite Implementation
   - Status: Pending
   - Priority: P0
   - Due: 2024-01-24T17:00:00.000Z
   - Components:
     - Unit tests for React components
     - Integration tests for API routes
     - E2E tests for critical flows

## Development Rules

1. Component Rules
   - Use centralized components
   - No custom navigation implementations
   - Maintain consistent styling
   - Preserve image aspect ratios

2. Architecture Rules
   - MongoDB connection at route level
   - UTC timestamps (ISO 8601)
   - Proper model registration
   - Container-based layouts

## Next Steps

1. Continue Vote and Swipe integration:
   - Follow ELO rating implementation
   - Maintain aspect ratio requirements
   - Ensure proper vote flow

2. Begin test suite planning:
   - Map critical components
   - Identify test scenarios
   - Set up testing infrastructure

## Notes

- All timestamps must use ISO 8601 UTC format with milliseconds
- Card aspect ratio preservation is non-negotiable
- Version updates follow semantic versioning
- Documentation must stay in sync with implementation
