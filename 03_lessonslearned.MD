# Lessons Learned

## Initial Setup Attempts and Failures (2025-04-11)
- Several attempts to initialize the project resulted in build failures on Vercel.

### JSON Syntax Errors
- The initial deployments failed with a "Unexpected non-whitespace character after JSON" error, indicating invalid JSON syntax in `vercel.json`. This was caused by multiple JSON objects in the file.
  - **Fix:** The `vercel.json` file was recreated with a single, valid JSON object:
  ```json
  {
    "version": 2,
    "builds": [
      { "src": "package.json", "use": "@vercel/next" }
    ]
  }
  ```
### Dependency Issues
- The `npm install` command failed during Vercel builds, suggesting issues with project dependencies.
  - **Troubleshooting:**
    - Cleared the npm cache and reinstalled dependencies locally.
    - Created a minimal `package.json` with only essential dependencies (next, react, react-dom).
  - **Fix:** Simplified the project structure and reduced external dependencies, focusing only on Next.js, React, and React DOM for the base implementation.
    - This involved removing potentially conflicting packages and configurations.

## Ongoing Challenges
- Ensuring a stable and reliable build process on Vercel continues to be a challenge.
- The MongoDB integration has not yet been re-implemented following the clean project restart.
- Further testing on Vercel is required after each change to confirm stability.

## Next Steps
- Re-implement the MongoDB integration step-by-step, ensuring each function works both locally and on Vercel.
- Add proper error handling and notifications to the user interface.
- Validate setup and configuration automatically with a build script.
