- Keep release notes focused on user-facing changes
- Document technical insights for future reference

## Frontend

### 2025-07-06T23:43:02.000Z - Vote Component Integration Fix

**Issue:** Vote card positioning was implemented in VoteBattle.v2.tsx but not being used, while the actual vote flow was using VoteComparison.tsx with old positioning.

**Root Cause:** Multiple implementations of vote card layout existed in the codebase, leading to inconsistent behavior.

**Resolution:**
- Identified the actual component flow: PlayPage → VotePhase → VoteComparison
- Updated VoteComparison.tsx with the correct positioning logic:
  - Navigation-relative positioning (80px + vh units)
  - 5% side margins with 90% width
  - Proper aspect ratio preservation
  - Consistent card spacing

**Key Learnings:**
- Always verify the complete component tree before implementing changes
- Check for duplicate implementations of similar functionality
- Ensure consistency across related components
- Document component relationships in architecture files

### 2025-07-06T23:39:02.000Z - Vote Card Navigation-Relative Positioning

**Issue:** Card positioning needed to be calculated relative to navigation bar instead of viewport top.

**Resolution:**
- Updated card positioning to use calc() with navigation height (80px)
- Implemented top-[calc(80px+5vh)] for first card
- Implemented top-[calc(80px+55vh)] for second card
- Maintained 90% width with 5% side margins

**Key Learnings:**
- Always position elements relative to their actual available space
- Use calc() for combining fixed and relative measurements
- Consider navigation height in viewport calculations

### 2025-07-06T22:00:00.000Z - Vote Container Responsive Sizing

**Issue:** Card containers needed responsive sizing while preserving aspect ratios.

**Resolution:**
- Implemented viewport-based container calculations
- Used min() function for responsive gaps
- Maintained aspect ratios through container constraints
- Added proper viewport height calculations

**Key Learnings:**
- Container-based sizing provides better control than direct card manipulation
- Viewport units enable consistent proportional spacing
- Gap calculations must account for total container height

### 2025-07-06T21:20:58Z - Image Aspect Ratio and Responsive Layout

**Issue:** Images were being cropped and distorted across different view modes (swipe, vote, ranking).

**Root Cause:** Each view had its own container logic and didn't respect original image dimensions.

**Resolution:**
- Implemented useImageDimensions hook for accurate image sizing
- Created calculateImageDimensions utility for aspect ratio preservation
- Built OrientationProvider for responsive layouts
- Centralized all image handling logic

**Key Learnings:**
- Always calculate and preserve image aspect ratios
- Use ResizeObserver for container size tracking
- Handle both portrait and landscape orientations explicitly
- Implement responsive layouts at the container level
- Keep image scaling logic separated from display components

### 2025-07-06T21:03:26Z - Critical Component Centralization

**Issue:** Lack of proper component centralization led to inconsistent UI implementations across pages.

**Root Cause:** Missing standardized component structure and unclear rules about component reuse.

**Resolution:**
- Created centralized Card component in common/Card.tsx
- Established proper layout hierarchy for all pages
- Enforced use of centralized Navigation and Card components
- Added architectural documentation for component usage

**Key Learnings:**
- Core UI components must be centralized in /components/common
- All pages must reuse these components without variation
- Layout components must be standardized and consistent
- Component documentation must explicitly state reuse requirements

### 2025-07-06T20:59:36Z - Navigation Component Consistency

**Issue:** Custom navigation implementation in ranking page deviated from centralized component, including unauthorized "Home" link.

**Root Cause:** Direct implementation of navigation in page component instead of using the centralized Navigation component.

**Resolution:**
- Removed custom navigation from ranking page
- Enforced use of centralized Navigation component
- Eliminated unauthorized navigation items

**Key Learnings:**
- Always use centralized components for consistent UI elements
- Never implement page-specific variations of global components
- Validate navigation items against approved structure
- Document component reuse requirements clearly

### 2025-07-06T20:57:00Z - Minimal Design Implementation

**Issue:** Inconsistent use of white backgrounds and containers across layouts affected visual consistency.

**Root Cause:** Different components were independently styled with their own background colors and container elements, leading to visual inconsistency.

**Resolution:**
- Removed bg-white classes from layout components
- Simplified container styling in error and not-found pages
- Enforced consistent minimal design across all pages

**Key Learnings:**
- Maintain consistent styling patterns across layouts
- Remove unnecessary decorative elements
- Keep visual hierarchy simple and clear
- Document styling decisions in component comments

## Backend

### MongoDB Integration
- When using MongoDB with Next.js API routes, ensure database connections are handled at the route level rather than in models to prevent connection conflicts
- Always validate incoming data before processing, especially for enumerated values like vote directions
- Use ISO 8601 UTC timestamps consistently for all date fields
- Handle both `_id` and `id` fields properly when working with MongoDB documents in TypeScript

### 2025-07-06T12:21:14Z - Model Registration Issue

**Issue:** Models were inadvertently registered multiple times across different modules leading to schema conflicts and memory leaks.

**Root Cause:** Lack of a centralized model registration strategy in the application architecture.

**Resolution:** Implemented a centralized registration pattern within the `/models` directory. Models are now registered once and reused through the model registry.

**Potential Pitfalls:**
- Ensure all models are included in the registry to prevent missing model errors.
- Avoid cyclic dependencies that can cause import issues.

### 2025-07-06T08:50:06Z - Next.js Configuration Warning

**Issue:** Invalid `next.config.js` configuration detected - unrecognized `strict` key in `typescript` configuration.

**Root Cause:** Next.js 14.0.4 no longer supports direct TypeScript configuration in `next.config.js`. TypeScript configuration should be managed through `tsconfig.json` instead.

**Resolution:** Removed typescript.strict from next.config.js as it's redundant with tsconfig.json settings.

## Design Guidelines

### Critical Fix: Ensuring Aspect Ratio Preservation
- Updated project to remove previous aspect ratio adjustments that led to distortion
- Implemented checks to prevent future modifications to image ratios
- Fixed handling in VoteComparison and Card components to preserve natural aspect ratios

### General Guidelines
- No breadcrumb navigation as per design policy
- Core UI flows (SWIPE → VOTE → RANKING) must be strictly linear
- Card designs must be consistent across all views
- No text overlays on cards in any view
- Responsive layouts must handle both portrait and landscape orientations

## Development Process

- Versioning system in place for all deployments
- Documentation kept current with implementation
- Component reuse enforced through centralization
- Image handling standardized across all views
- Layout responsiveness handled at container level
