# 50 First Dates - Project Status & AI Memory

## Date: 2025-04-11

### Project Goal
Create a simple message board application using Next.js 14, Tailwind CSS, and MongoDB for persistence.

### Current Progress

1.  ✅ Basic project structure and setup using `create-next-app`.
2.  ✅ Created a functional message board with a centered input field and messages displayed below.
3.  ❌ Encountered deployment issues related to `package.json` and `vercel.json`.
4.  ✅ Created a clean git history by removing existing repo and building incrementally.
5.  ✅ Simplified package.json.
6.  ✅ Setup up Git remote
7.  ❌ There is not MongoDB connection

### Current Challenges

1.  Ensuring reliable Vercel deployments.
2.  Implementing proper error handling and user feedback.
3.  Setting up MongoDB integration correctly.

### Known Working State
- A basic Next.js application with a simple message board UI that:
  - Allows typing and submitting messages
  - Displays messages in a list
  - Uses local state to manage messages

### Next Steps
1. Setup MongoDB connection
2. Implement API endpoints for message creation
3. Ensure full build process

### Notes
- Be careful when creating the .env.local use the correct credentials to MONGODB otherwise wont work
