# Done Is Better Development Diary - 50 First Dates

**Current State**: ðŸŸ¢ Kanban Board Layout with Swipe-to-Move Implemented.
**Last Updated**: 2025-04-13
**Deployment**: https://doneisbetter-1hcbxr4x7-narimato.vercel.app
**Version**: v0.4.0

## Latest Development (v0.4.0)

### 2025-04-13: Kanban Board Layout
- Updated `getCards` action to fetch all cards (not just 'active').
- Created `KanbanBoard.js` client component to manage state for 'Deleted', 'Active', and 'Done' columns.
- Created `Column.js` client component to render each column.
- Modified `CardItem.js` to call a new `onStatusUpdate` prop function upon successful swipe action.
- Updated `page.js` to use `KanbanBoard` instead of `CardList`.
- Added CSS Grid styles for the 3-column layout.
- Successfully deployed v0.4.0 to Vercel production.
## Latest Development (v0.3.0)

### 2025-04-13: Swipe Actions Implementation
- Added `react-swipeable` dependency.
- Updated `Card` schema in `actions.js` to include a `status` field ('active', 'done', 'deleted').
- Modified `getCards` action to only fetch 'active' cards.
- Created `updateCardStatus` server action to set 'done' or 'deleted' status.
- Refactored card display into client components: `CardList.js` (manages local state) and `CardItem.js` (handles swipe logic).
- Implemented swipe left (delete) and swipe right (done) gestures using `useSwipeable`.
- Added optimistic UI update: card is removed from the list immediately on swipe completion.
- Added visual feedback (background color change) during swipe.
- Successfully deployed v0.3.0 to Vercel production.
## Latest Development (v0.2.0)

### 2025-04-13: Input Field and Card Display
- Installed Mongoose for database interaction.
- Created MongoDB connection utility (`lib/db.js`).
- Implemented server actions (`createCard`, `getCards`) with error handling and revalidation.
- Developed client-side Input component (`components/Input.js`) with active/loading/error states and event handling (submit, escape, click outside).
- Updated main page (`app/page.js`) to use Input component, fetch cards via `getCards`, and display them in a list.
- Added basic CSS styling for layout, input, and cards, including dark mode support.
- Successfully deployed v0.2.0 to Vercel production.
## Latest Development (v0.1.0)

- MongoDB connection with Mongoose
- Basic CSS styling
- Error handling implementation

### Current Capabilities
- Text input with focus states
- MongoDB data persistence

- Basic CSS styling and dark mode support
- Swipe left/right to mark cards as deleted/done.
- Cards move between 'Deleted', 'Active', and 'Done' columns based on swipe actions.

### Next Steps
- Add input animations
- Implement dark mode
- Add card editing

## Project Status
- Core features implemented
- Basic testing in place

- Basic styling only
- Optimistic updates lack robust error recovery (if server action fails after UI update).
- Currently no way to move cards back from 'Deleted' or 'Done' columns via UI.
- Simple CRUD operations

### Future Considerations
- User authentication
- User authentication
- Advanced card features
- Search functionality
- Analytics integration
