# Done Is Better Development Diary - 50 First Dates

**Current State**: ðŸŸ¢ Urbanist Font Integrated (via Standard CSS).
**Last Updated**: 2025-04-13T14:05:00.000Z
**Deployment**: https://doneisbetter-7yqr97f90-narimato.vercel.app
**Version**: v0.9.0

## Latest Development (v0.9.0)

### 2025-04-18T18:33:59.722546+02:00: Authentication Implementation Rollback
- Reverted to stable commit 9375766 (v1.1.1)
- Cleaned all auth-related changes
- Documented implementation challenges in LESSONS_LEARNED.md
- Successfully redeployed stable version

### 2025-04-18T18:28:22.943481+02:00: Successful Rollback
- Integrated Urbanist Google Font (Light 300, ExtraBold 800) using `next/font/google` and CSS variables.
- Styled main title `#DONEISBETTER` with specified weights.
- Encountered persistent, conflicting PostCSS/Tailwind build errors related to plugin configuration and utility class recognition (`font-light`).
- Resolved build errors by removing `@tailwind` directives from `globals.css` and applying font weights and styles via standard CSS selectors, effectively bypassing the problematic Tailwind processing layer for this feature. Manually created config files after `npx init` failed.
- Successfully built and deployed the application with the new font applied via standard CSS.

## Previous Development History

### 2025-04-13T11:07:00.000Z: Fix Card Timestamp Display (v0.8.2)
- Debugged and corrected structural errors in `CardItem.js` that were causing timestamps to display incorrectly (showing locale format instead of the intended raw ISO string).
- Confirmed the component now correctly renders the full UTC ISO 8601 string (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ`).
- Finalized documentation updates with correct ISO 8601 timestamps.

### Future Considerations
- User authentication
- Advanced card features
