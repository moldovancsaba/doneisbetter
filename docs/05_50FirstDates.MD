# Done Is Better Development Diary - 50 First Dates

## v1.7.1 - Google Authentication & Fixes (2025-04-23T16:45:00+02:00)

### Summary
Successfully implemented Google Authentication using NextAuth.js, integrated user persistence with MongoDB, and updated server actions for user-specific card management. Resolved several build errors related to TypeScript types, path resolution, and production environment variables. The application now supports user login, and cards are associated with the logged-in user.

### Key Changes
- **Authentication:** Integrated NextAuth.js with Google Provider.
- **Database:** Added User model; updated Card model to link to User.
- **Server Actions:** Modified `createCard`, `updateCardStatus`, `getCards` to be user-aware and use MongoDB `_id`.
- **Session:** Implemented session provider and updated UI (`AuthButtons`, conditional rendering on `HomePage`).
- **Structure:** Moved DB connection and models to `src/lib` for better path resolution.
- **Fixes (v1.7.1):** Addressed build errors (`unknown` type for `_id`, path resolution, missing `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`), removed Mongoose index warnings.

### Status
- **ðŸŸ¢ COMPLETE & VERIFIED:** Feature implemented, documented, committed (0576569), tagged (v1.7.1), and deployed successfully.
- **ðŸŸ¢ TESTED:** User confirmed login/logout works as expected on production. Card loading and creation after login are functional.
- **Definition of Done:** All criteria met.

### Links
- **Deployment:** https://doneisbetter-cvypuh09x-narimato.vercel.app
- **Commit:** `0576569` (Specific commit hash for v1.7.1 fixes)

**Project is stable and ready for the next task.**
