## 2025-04-13: Kanban Layout Implementation (v0.4.0)

### Challenge: Managing Multiple Client-Side States from Server Data
**Issue**: Needed to display cards in three distinct columns ('Deleted', 'Active', 'Done') based on their status, manage moves between these columns client-side after server actions, using data initially fetched on the server.
**Solution**:
1.  Created a parent client component (`KanbanBoard.js`) responsible for managing the state of all three columns (`deletedCards`, `activeCards`, `doneCards`).
2.  Used `useEffect` within `KanbanBoard.js` to filter the `initialCards` prop (fetched server-side in `page.js`) into the appropriate column state arrays. This effect re-runs if `initialCards` changes (e.g., after adding a new card and the page revalidates).
3.  Implemented a handler function (`handleStatusUpdate`) in `KanbanBoard.js` that finds the card in any list, removes it, and adds it to the correct new list based on the `newStatus` received from `CardItem.js`.
**Lesson**: For complex UIs derived from server data but requiring interactive client-side state manipulation (like moving items between lists), a dedicated parent client component acting as a state manager is effective. It centralizes the logic for distributing and updating items based on actions triggered in child components.

### Refactoring for Reusability
**Observation**: The structure for displaying a list of cards within a column was repetitive.
**Solution**: Created a `Column.js` component that takes `title` and `cards` as props and renders the column structure, including mapping `cards` to `CardItem.js`. This simplified `KanbanBoard.js`.
**Lesson**: Identify repeating UI structures and extract them into reusable components to keep parent components cleaner and more focused on state management or layout orchestration.

## 2025-04-13: Swipe Action Implementation (v0.3.0)

### Challenge: Client-Side State Management for Server Data
**Issue**: Needed to implement swipe gestures and optimistic UI updates (removing a card visually before server confirmation) for data initially fetched on the server.
**Solution**:
1.  Refactored the card display logic from the server component (`page.js`) into client components (`CardList.js`, `CardItem.js`).
2.  Passed the initial server-fetched data (`initialCards`) as a prop to `CardList.js`.
3.  `CardList.js` initializes its own state (`cards`) with `initialCards` and manages this state for optimistic updates.
4.  `CardItem.js` receives a callback (`onSwipeComplete`) from `CardList.js` to notify it when a server action succeeds, allowing `CardList.js` to update its local `cards` state.
**Lesson**: For interactive lists with optimistic updates based on server data, fetch initial data server-side but manage the list's state client-side, passing the initial data as a prop.

### Best Practice: Optimistic UI Updates
**Observation**: Removing the card immediately from the UI upon swipe completion provides a much smoother user experience than waiting for the server action to complete.
**Solution**: The `onSwipeComplete` callback in `CardItem` triggers `setCards` in `CardList` *immediately* after the `updateCardStatus` server action promise resolves successfully.
**Lesson**: Implement optimistic UI updates for actions like deletion or status changes to improve perceived performance. Acknowledge the need for potential error recovery logic if the server action fails post-update.

### Tool Integration: `react-swipeable`
**Observation**: The `react-swipeable` library provided a straightforward way to implement swipe detection with necessary configurations (threshold, mouse tracking, scroll prevention).
**Lesson**: Leverage well-maintained libraries for common interaction patterns like swipe gestures to save development time and ensure robustness. Pay attention to configuration options like `preventScrollOnSwipe` and `touchAction` CSS for good mobile behavior.

## 2025-04-13: Core Functionality Implementation (v0.2.0)

### Challenge: Server Actions and Client Components
**Issue**: Managing state updates and error feedback between client components (`Input.js`) and server actions (`createCard`).
**Solution**:
1.  Server action (`createCard`) returns a serializable object `{ success: boolean, error?: string }`.
2.  Client component (`Input.js`) uses `await` to call the server action and checks the `result` object.
3.  Client component sets local state (`error`, `isLoading`) based on the server action's response.
4.  Used `revalidatePath('/')` in the server action to trigger data refresh on the page after successful creation.
**Lesson**: Server actions should return clear, serializable status/error information for client components to act upon. `revalidatePath` is crucial for updating server-rendered data after mutations.

### Challenge: MongoDB Connection Management
**Issue**: Ensuring the database connection is established reliably without redundant connections in a serverless context.
**Solution**: Implemented a connection utility (`lib/db.js`) that checks `mongoose.connection.readyState` before attempting a new connection. Included basic error handling and logging.
**Lesson**: A shared connection utility with state checking is essential for database interactions in serverless functions/actions.

### Best Practice: Data Serialization
**Observation**: Data fetched directly from Mongoose (`getCards`) needs to be serialized before being passed from server components/actions to client components. Dates and ObjectIds are common issues.
**Solution**: Used `.lean()` in the Mongoose query and explicitly converted `_id` to string and `createdAt` to ISO string format before returning from `getCards`.
**Lesson**: Always ensure data passed between server and client boundaries is serializable (plain objects, strings, numbers, etc.). Convert complex types like ObjectIds and Dates appropriately.

## 2025-04-12: Initial Setup and Deployment

### Challenge: Next.js Build Configuration
**Issue**: Initial Vercel deployment failed due to TypeScript and ESLint configurations.

**Solution**:
1. Simplified project structure:
   ```javascript
   // Removed unnecessary TypeScript and ESLint configs
   // Kept only essential files:
   - src/app/page.js
   - src/app/layout.js
   - src/app/globals.css
   ```

**Lesson**: Start with minimal configuration and add complexity incrementally.

### Challenge: MongoDB Integration
**Issue**: MongoDB connection management in serverless environment.

**Solution**:
1. Implemented connection pooling:
   ```javascript
   if (mongoose.connection.readyState === 1) {
     return mongoose.connection;
   }
   ```
2. Added proper error handling
3. Used environment variables for configuration

**Lesson**: Always implement connection pooling in serverless environments.

### Challenge: CSS Module Integration
**Issue**: Initial styling approach with Tailwind caused build issues.

**Solution**:
1. Switched to CSS Modules for simplicity
2. Implemented basic, clean styling
3. Removed unnecessary PostCSS plugins

**Lesson**: Choose simpler styling solutions for initial implementations.
