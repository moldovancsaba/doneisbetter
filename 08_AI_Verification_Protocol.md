# 08_AI_VERIFICATION_PROTOCOL.md — DONEISBETTER

## 🧪 AI Content Verification Protocol

All AI-generated output must follow a **strict verification process** before it can be accepted into the *doneisbetter* project. No exceptions.

| Content          | Aligned with project scope, stack, and naming conventions     |
| Functionality    | Code must be testable, modular, and match described purpose   |
| File Readiness   | Must be ready-to-use `.md` or `.js` file — no gaps or stubs   |
| Deployment Claim | Only state deploy status if it was **verifiably triggered**   |

## 🚨 Critical Violations (Must NEVER Occur)

| Violation                          | Consequence                           |
|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Generating incomplete `.md` files  | Document invalid; must be regenerated  |
| Referencing unstaged deployments   | Marked as misleading, must be removed  |
| Stating “this document provides…”  | Entire response disqualified           |
| Claiming commit/deploy without proof | Considered hallucination              |

## 🔍 AI Verification Flow

1. **Step 1 — Self-validation**  
   AI checks structure, formatting, and logic against documentation rules.

2. **Step 2 — User confirmation**  
   File must be downloaded or viewed by the user.

3. **Step 3 — Confirmation by Output**  
   Final version must reflect verified deployment or ready-for-use output.

---

## 📌 Enforcement

This protocol is binding. Any AI-generated output that bypasses these rules must be deleted and recreated according to this verification process. The protocol itself is versioned and applied retroactively if needed.
